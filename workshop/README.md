## Analyzing Health Care data with Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the Cloud Pak for Data platform to Collect Data, Organize Data, Analyze Data, and Infuse AI into our applications. The goals of this workshop are:

* Collect and virtualize data
* Visualize data with Data Refinery
* Create and deploy a machine learning model
* Monitor the model
* Create a Python app to use the model
